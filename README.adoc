== Kotlin vs. Java
I use Kotlin instead of Java in this project to evaluate the differences between the languages.

=== Data class
Kotlin makes it very easy to create dumb data classes. Even if you make the class members public in Java, it is still much more verbose.
.Java
[source,java]
----
public class StockLatestPriceResponse {
  public String symbol;
  public BigDecimal latestPrice;

  public StockLatestPriceResponse() {
  }

  public StockLatestPriceResponse(String symbol, BigDecimal latestPrice) {
    this.symbol = symbol;
    this.latestPrice = latestPrice;
  }
}
----

.Kotlin
[source,java]
----
class StockLatestPriceResponse(val symbol: String, val name: String, val latestPrice: BigDecimal) {
}
----

=== Nullpointer checking

.Java
[source,java]
----
  @Path("/{symbol}/latestPrice")
  @GET
  public Response stock(@PathParam("symbol") String symbol) throws IOException {
    Stock stock = YahooFinance.get(symbol);
    Response response = null;
    if (stock == null) {
      response = Response.status(Response.Status.NOT_FOUND).build();
    } else {
      StockLatestPriceResponse stockResponse = new StockLatestPriceResponse(stock.getSymbol(), stock.getQuote().getPrice());
      response = Response.ok(stockResponse).build();
    }
    return response;
  }
----

.Kotlin
[source,java]
----
  @Path("/{symbol}/latestPrice")
  @GET
  @Throws(IOException::class)
  fun stock(@PathParam("symbol") symbol: String): Response {
    val stock: Stock? = YahooFinance.get(symbol)
    val response: Response = if (stock == null) {
      Response.status(Response.Status.NOT_FOUND).build()
    } else {
      val stockResponse = StockLatestPriceResponse(stock.symbol, stock.name, stock.quote.price)
      Response.ok(stockResponse).build()
    }
    return response
  }
----

Here the code is about the same size, but the greatest difference is in handling potential null pointers. The variable "stock" could be
null and it is explicitly labeled as such. The response is result from the if statement, which is an expression in Kotlin and makes it
easy to see how response is determined.
